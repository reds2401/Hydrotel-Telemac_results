# Hydrotel-Telemac_results
Process and analyse results from Hydrotel and Telemac2D
___

Using Hydrotel results in the form of text files containing flow timeseries:

1. Read hydrotel results and generate a hydrograph of a particular event to be used in a Telemac Unsteady state simulation
2. Build and plot flow-duration curves and plot a subset of the flow timeseries (a hydrograph).

Then, using Telemac2D results generated with BlueKenue:

1. Use water stage result timeseries to analyse maximum water elevations for multiple hydrographs. Plot result figures.
2. Use water depth mesh to extract and analyse maximum and minimum water extensions for multiple hydrographs. Create files with the grid coordinates and depth for each condition.
